# Gagan Sopori

I develop software that bridges the gap between digital logic and physical utility. My work focuses on Python-based automation, IoT systems, and assistive hardware.

### Core Projects

* **OSAGE:** Hardware and software for gauging Obstructive Sleep Apnea.
* **Smart Greenhouse:** Automated climate control and sensor monitoring for sustainable agriculture.
* **Play-Mirror:** An ambient interface for information delivery via smart-mirror hardware.
* **Pi-Watch:** A bedside utility for time and radio, built on Raspberry Pi.
* **News-BulletIn:** A news aggregator designed to reduce media bias through data.

### Technical Focus

* **Primary Tooling:** Python, Linux, Raspberry Pi/Microcontrollers.
* **Domains:** IoT Architecture, Sensor Integration, Embedded UI.

### Principles

I aim for technology that:
1. Solves a specific, tangible problem.
2. Works in the background with minimal user intervention.
3. Prioritizes longevity and repairability.
